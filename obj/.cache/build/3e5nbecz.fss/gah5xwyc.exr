<p>Microsoft has released Exchange Server 2016 for download. The RTM (first) build of Exchange Server 2016 was released in October 2015.</p>
<p>With the cloud-first approach that Microsoft has these days there are few surprises in the release of Exchange Server 2016, as many of the features have been rolling out in Exchange Online already. In Microsoft's own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the new features in Exchange Server 2016 were birthed in the cloud and then refined in a feedback loop that includes millions of mailboxes deployed worldwide. The same is true of back-end improvements to Exchange architecture, high availability, and storage. We are now working to bring these elements to the diverse world of on-premises environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with any Exchange Server release there are some significant changes, as well as improvements, for customers and IT admins to get up to speed on.</p>
